# Credit Risk Modeling Project

This project shows the development and evaluation of credit risk models using Python. 

The models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was provided by DataCamp as part of the
[Credit Risk Modeling in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/credit-risk-modeling-in-python) course.

## Project Structure

- `script.ipynb` — main Jupyter notebook with model building steps
- `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` — project dependencies managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Remark
This project showcases what I learned from the Credit Risk Modeling in Python course on DataCamp.
